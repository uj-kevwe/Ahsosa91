            The School started admitting students as a private day and boarding school in September, 1978 at Baruwa Village, Ipaja Road. 
            The location was exactly the side of the entrance of Abesan Estate where there is a Redeemed Christian Church of God. 
            The school earlier existed few years back in Morocco Road, Shomolu  with the name Niger Secondary Commercial College. 
            The proprietress was Mrs. Anifowoshe. 
            At inception students were admitted to forms one and two in 1978.

            The following academic session 1979/1980 was a watershed in the life history of the school . There was a change in goverment 
          from the military to civilian regime, as a result of this change in political environment in the country, the proprietoress 
          sensing an imminent change in the ownership of the school, made a frantic effort to prevent the government from taking over 
          her property (the school). She locked up the school and prevented the students and staff from entering the school.
          However, with the help of the Parents/Teachers Association and the public, the government took over the school. 
          The students had to peacefully march from Baruwa to the Old Secretariat, GRA, Ikeja. 
          When the government of Lateef Jakande took over the school, the School was renamed Baruwa Grammar School. The proprietoress 
          made another move to reclaim her property by torching the wooden building of the school with fire overnight.

          The PTA and the government did some repairs.  A new principal Mr. E.A Lojede was brought to head the school. The students 
          promoted to form three (3) were moved to St. Joseph Secondary School, Mongoro, Agege  while the forms two (2)    students and 
          the new students were left in the school. The reason for that decision was to take care of the academic needs of the form 
          three (3) students due to the lack of adequate infrastructure. 
          Those days, the academic curriculum was structured in such a way to expose the students in form three (3) to several new 
          subjects including the sciences in preparation for the WAEC School Certificate and in form four they will be required to pick 
          their choices and departments.
          The State Government eventually moved the school from Baruwa to the present location. This was done to create a better a
          tmosphere for the students and for the school to serve the educational needs of the Abesan Estate that was being constructed 
          at that time. 
          The name of the school was then changed to Estate Grammar School. The pioneer students of 142 graduated in 1983 having 
          completed the mandatory 5-year period of academic exercise in the school.

            The Old Students Association was formed and the launching done in the school premises in 1996 when Mrs. Banmore was the 
          Principal of the school.
          Due to lack of telephone and communication infrastructure, reaching one another was difficult and 'the centre could not hold' 
          any further.
          The efforts of the younger generation of the alumni succeeded in forming set groups before the central foundation was 
          eventually laid through the effort of the immediate past principal, Mrs. Lami Akinyemi and the set groups
